# Simple-Network-Vuln-Scanner-Threat-Modeling-Demo-
This script "hunts for holes" in a pretend network like a game of hide-and-seek. It checks for "easy breaks" and suggests fixes, like your STIG-driven models.

Basic Python vuln scanner simulating NIST threat modeling for space networks. Identifies 15+ potential gaps in a mock orbital setup. Ties to my dissertation on quantum barriers.
